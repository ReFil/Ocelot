Ocelot universal vehicle interface

This is an in progress project aimed at creating a universal set of hardware intended to allow autonomous driving.
The hardware consists of a fly by wire pedal interceptor, a universal cruise controls emulator, reverse engineered white panda and black panda, canbus gateway board for iboosters or corolla EPS controllers and an interface board that ties everythign together
In the future we plan on a cable throttle actuator and a speed and pedal sensor to allow for fitting on cars without any electronics at all.

The software for most of the modules is based off the comma.ai panda firmware to take advantage of the safety and updating over CAN bus
